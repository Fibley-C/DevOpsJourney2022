# DevOpsJourney2022
Journey into DevOps

Idea here is to lay out a roadmap on what tools would be useful for starting of as a DevOps engineer. Starting off with a local lab, then seeing if we can push out to a production enviroment such as Azure.

# 1. Terraform

# 2. Ansible

# 3. Docker/Docker-compose

# 4. GitHub Actions

# 5. Kubernetes (optional)
